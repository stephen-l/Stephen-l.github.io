First of all, welcome to my blog and my first post. I wanted to start off with some older content that I have been meaning to post somewhere.

PicoCTF is a great CTF for beginners all the way to experts in cyber security. It has a variety of categories for different skills such as reverse engineering, forensics, web exploitation and more.

For the first post, I'm going to write up my solutions for the first few challenges. Most of the solutions will be in Python depending on the challenge.

**Description/Question:**

```
Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?
```

**Solution**

A quick trick to help converting small decimal numbers (base 10) to binary (base 2) is to write out bits, bit by bit, until you have a single bit with a value larger than your decimal value.

For example, if we look at the decimal values of 8 bits we can see that `42` is less than 64, but greater than 32, so we only need to focus on the first 6 bits.

binary |0|0|1|1|1|1|1|1|
value |128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|

Then we need to add 32 to the number before it, 16, and do the less and and greater than check again. So `32 + 16 = 48` 48 is higher than, so we don't use 16.

binary |0|0|`1`|0|1|1|1|1|
value |128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|

Next we try adding 8 to 32 `32 + 8 = 40`, 40 is lower than 42 so we will keep that bit.

binary |0|0|`1`|0|`1`|1|1|1|
value |128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|

Continuing on, `40 + 4 = 44` so we will turn off this bit.

binary |0|0|`1`|0|`1`|0|1|1|
value |128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|

And then finally, `40 + 2 = 42` meaning we can leave this bit on and turn the last bit off.

binary |0|0|`1`|0|`1`|0|`1`|0|
value |128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|

Our final binary number is `00101010`, shortened to `101010` because the higher value bits on the left aren't used.

Wrapping our answer in the Pico tag we get: `picoCTF{101010}`
