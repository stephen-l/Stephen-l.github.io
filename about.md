My name is Stephen, I've worked in Cyber Security for a number of years. My roles have primarily been in DFIR and malware analysis.

I've created this blog to be able to write and share some of the interesting samples or campaigns I find in the wild, and CTFs that I have completed.

Research and opinions expressed are solely my own and not research or opinions of my current or previous employers.
